Hey! The new car driver arrived!
I'm Steve, the car engineer. 
I don't think that you are good enough to race against anyone.
Hovewer, there are [b]three beginner tracks[/b] that you can try at your own.
Be careful and learn the right technique! Don't drive too fast, otherwise you won't be able to control the car.
Use the [b]arrows to drive[/b] and [b]press R to reset the car[/b] after an accident.
Keep in mind: [b]Only the best are able to win.[/b] You have to be more than just good.
Later on you can try the [b]multiplayer[/b] mode.
[color=aqua]Good luck![/color]
